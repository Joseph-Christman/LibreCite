# LibreCite
Librecite will be a QT app that provides a free and libre way to produce
citations of books, websites, and more.

### Compilation Instructions
WARNING: APPLICATION ISN'T DONE AND THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE REALLY ROUGH.

To obtain a Makefile, type `qmake -o Makefile librecalc.pro` while
you are in the src directory.

To compile the program, type `make`.

### Must have Features

-Ability to save and load in some format (XML possibly? QT seems to have
native support for that)

-The basic format in the layout plan

### Stretch Goals

-Snap/Flatpak support?
