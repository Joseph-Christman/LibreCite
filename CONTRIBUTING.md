All code is in Stroustrup style.

Please try not to have more than 75 chars in a line for terminal folks.

Try not to break anything that isn't already broken.

If you're going to drag in new dependencies, please ask first.

If you're implementing a new feature, it would nice if you told me 
ahead of time.


That's it.
