Hi, this is a doc for Bart. It will probably be deleted in a couple
weeks. It's mostly just a summary of the current state of the project.

What works:
-The new project button will open a project in tmpFiles. You can add
book citations to this project. The project will be restored upon opening.

-If you click a previously made citaition's button, you can get the MLA 
citation

What needs work:
-Need a lot more types of citations (movies, articles, etc)

-A lot more citation categories (APA, etc)

-The ability to have multiple folders

-The menu bar

-The Open Project button
